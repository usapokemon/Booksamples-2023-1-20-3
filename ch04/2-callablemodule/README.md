# Getting Started with Manually-created App 

Since we are learning JavaScript as the prerequisite skill for the frontend React programming, we will adopt the ES Module method. We will use ECMA2023 Specification for the purpose of creating a callable module. 

# How do you generate a callable module?
We will use export or export default in the callable module file, and import <name> or import {<name> } in the calling React file. We will NOT use require statements to import a callable module in a React file as defined for CommonJS modules.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
